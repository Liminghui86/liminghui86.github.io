          Mr Li is a very caring and patient teacher who put all his effort in teaching. He will never hesitate to help his students, even outside tuition hours. Moreover, he will make sure that I understand the concepts clearly and willing to clear any doubt I have at any point of time. Mr Li is also very knowledgeable in what he teaches and will provide clear solutions and explanations. As a kind and passionate teacher, he will often try to make his lessons interesting and engaging.

          Mr Samuel Li is a good teacher. The concepts he taught has allowed me to understand the basics and fundamentals for math. He is also very motivating and patient when he teaches. I feel that despite my setbacks faced, he helps not only in explaining key areas of weaknesses, but also provides moral boosts. Thank you Samuel!

          Mr Samuel has excellent conceptual knowledge; and is therefore able to impart huge concepts in bite size pieces. He taught me [vectors and complex] in a really simple manner - relative to my school tutors - and I have been able to solve almost every complex/vectors! Thank you Mr Samuel!

          Mr Samuel is a really cheerful teacher. I love his style of teaching as he teaches and go through many applications which can be applied in both paper and also in life. He made complicated physics questions easy to catch and doable. Mr Samuel has a blog where he shares his experiences as a student and how he overcame difficult circumstances in studies and exams. I think his blog is really useful as it can help to motivate students. Overall, I really enjoyed myself as a student! =)

          1 of the best teachers I met in my life. He is the only teacher who always text me to do my work and motivates me. He also share with me his story and he overcomes it which also motivates me. His blog is very useful as it is telling how to overcomes the distractions and how to succeed in life. I hope he posts more blog to motivate more students. He always give an example to make the topic or the concept easy to understand. He is the best!!!

          Mr Samuel Li is an excellent teacher in mathematics and physics. He is able to break complicated concepts with real life example for me to understand better. For mathematics, he would constantly reinforce the formulas so that I could remember eventually. Besides being just a teacher, he is also a friend as well. He would ask how am I doing in school and also concern for the results I have in school. He is very encouraging and excellent tutor. I'm glad to be taught by him.

          Mr Samuel Li is honestly a brilliant teacher. He knows his concepts really well, and applies them as if he created those theories. He tries his best to make lessons engaging even though four hours of tuition straight is honestly tiring. Even after lessons, he makes the effort to constantly remind me to keep revising my work so that I will not forget anything that I have learnt so far. His encouragements and reminders have certainty made a major impact on me than you can ever imagine.

          Mr Samuel is a very good tutor. He always messages me at night to check if I am okay, or need any help with my homework. He also motivates me and helps me set realistic goals for my subjects. He has always gone the extra mile!
